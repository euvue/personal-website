In the last month, I stumbled an NoCode, LowCode website & web apps builder. This website builder, [softr.io](https://softr.io), had a job board template that caught my attention. Immediately, I created an account and I started tinkering with the job board template. While I was tinkering around with the job board, I opened another browser tab and I browsed to [namecheap.com](https://namecheap.com) for a niche job board domain name. Traumatized, I queried for a geo-location niched job board, **Mplsjobs.com**

Surprisingly, mplsjobs.com was available on namecheap. I immediate bought mplsjobs.com for my job board project. After purchasing the domain name, I went back to softr.io to setup an [airtable](https://airtable.com) base for the job board. Furthermore, I decided to build as my first NoCode web app.

3 weeks later, I have customized the job board by creating a logo using namecheap's free logo maker, choose a background color, and integrated third-party apps. In addition, I associated the domain name, mplsjobs.com, with the job board template and it is officially published & live.

[Mplsjobs.com](https://mplsjobs.com) is and will be continouse integration and development. For now, I need to find a way to grow the website organically. I will add another blog post with the details of the job board integrations.
